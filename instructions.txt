This is my skeleton for a fullstack application for the mern stack. 
I have yet to work too much with mongo db, but this bit here will allow 
uploading to cyclic and getting things going. 


1. after adding changes to the react js application, "npm run build" and replace the 
build folder in here with the build folder in this folder. 
2. make sure that the react js project calls the correct endpoints. 
3. upload this to the github repository, and then connect to cyclic and upload. 


FOR UPLOADING TO GITHUB: 
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "update to project" 
3. git push -u -f origin main
